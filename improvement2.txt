The Awesome IBAN Input

Our creative team found out, that the users are still not satisfied with
the way they can submit an IBAN into our system, as they need to enter
so many zeros into it. To solve this problem we came up with the
following new requirements to make the life of our customers easier:

 - When the user entered the beginning part of an IBAN (at least two
   letters) and they press the TAB key, the input field should be filled
   with as many zeros as are needed to reach the maximum 24 characters
   of an IBAN.
 - After that the users should still be able to enter the ending numbers
   of the IBAN.
 - Whenever the user is pressing a number after that, one of the middle
   0 characters should be removed, and the entered number should be
   appended to the end.
 - The above behaviour should only continue until there is no more of
   the middle zero characters left.
 - Don't forget to implement a behaviour for the BACKSPACE key.

Good Luck!
