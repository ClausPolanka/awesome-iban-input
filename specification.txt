The Awesome IBAN input

Welcome to team George! So far we managed to provide one of the best
netbanking experiences in the world. So we can keep our market leading
position, we come up with new ways to impress our customers as often as
possible. Our creative team found another way to make the life of our
users better with a revolutionary way to enter the International Bank
Account Number to our system.

First a few facts about the International Bank Account Number:

 - At the moment our system supports International Bank Account Numbers
   that are 24 characters long.
 - The first two characters are always country codes and as such can
   only be letters from A-Z.
 - The last 22 characters are numbers.
 - The International Bank Account Number is usually displayed in a
   format split to groups of 4 characters.
 - Most of the International Bank Account Numbers contain the number
   zero a lot of time around the middle.

To help our customers submit this difficult numbers into our system, we
need you to implement a new component, the AwesomeIBANInput that other
developers can use on their forms. The creative team requires the
following features for this component:

 - The users should only be able to enter as many characters as long an
   IBAN can be.
 - To make the IBAN more readable, the entered IBAN should automatically
   be formatted so that it is displayed in groups of four characters.
