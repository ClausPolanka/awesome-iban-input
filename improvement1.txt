The Awesome IBAN Input

Our creative team found out, that the users are entering the wrong
characters way to often into our awesome iban input field. To avoid this
confusion, we would like to introduce some changes:

 - Our awesome input field should only allow letters to be entered into
   the first two positions and only numbers into the last 22 positions.
 - When the user is trying to enter the wrong character, our awesome
   input field should give a visual clue that his action was refused.
   The design team suggest flashing the input field red for a second.

Good Luck!
